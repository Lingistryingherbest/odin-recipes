    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Can you tell what my favorite breakfast food is or do I have to telepathically infect you with my love of flat cakes through the screen? Makes 6 blueberry pancakes; all measurements are in line with the agak agak (follow your heart) philosophy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>3 tbs sugar (sugar cuts through the tang of yogurt better, but I think honey already does the trick as a sweetener!)</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup greek yogurt</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>As many blueberries as you see fit!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix well and fry batter on the stove!</li>
        <li>Drizzle any syrup of your choice (optional), and serve!</li>
    </ol>
