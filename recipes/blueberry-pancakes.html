    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Can you tell what my favorite breakfast food is or do I have to telepathically infect you with my love of flat cakes through the screen? Makes 6 blueberry pancakes; all measurements are in line with the agak agak (follow your heart) philosophy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>3 tbs sugar (sugar cuts through the tang of yogurt better, but I think honey already does the trick as a sweetener!)</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup greek yogurt</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>As many blueberries as you see fit!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat your potato until soft in the crusty microwave of the common area, and then mash it with the only fork you own. </li>
        <li>Combine with beaten egg and appropriate amount of flour until a kneadable ball of dough forms.</li>
        <li>Season dough with salt and pepper, and parmesan.</li>
        <li>Play with dough and contemplate your existence as a college student. Skip if you have already done so for lunch to preserve your mental health.</li>
        <li>Form little bits of dough, roughly the lenth of one-third of your forefinger. No need for perfection. Cooking is chill. </li>
        <li>For the sauce, toast carrots and diced tomato on stove until soft, and then add jar of sauce to the consistency of your liking.</li>
        <li>Season sauce with parmesan powder, chili flakes, and salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Boil gnocchi for 3 minutes in salted water, drench in sauce and serve! </li>
    </ol>
